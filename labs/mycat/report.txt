For comparing both programs, 2 files were created with useless text.

time cat hola.txt adios.txt
The execution time of the regular cat is 0.005s

time ./a.out hola.txt adios.txt
The execution time of my cat is 0.167s

The regular cat is faster by 0.162s or 33.4 times faster.
My cat reads and writes one character at a time, this is probably the reson why it's slower.
